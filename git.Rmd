To get the most out of this content, you should have installed relevant software (git and a git client), connected git with RStudio, and created a GitHub account before proceeding. Instructions for doing all that can be found in Chapters 4-9 of [this book](http://happygitwithr.com) (note -- all the rest of those chapters are also awesome).

## Other materials

There's a lot of stuff to help with git in general, and with git for R in particular. This is a non-exhaustive list:

* Jenny Bryan's [book](http://happygitwithr.com) (same as the link above)
* The [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide
* Version control with [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
