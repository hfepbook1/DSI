This page has some stuff about Git / GitHub / GitHub with R, and is the basis for a computing club meeting. 

People will get the most out of that meeting if they've installed relevant software (git, RStudio, a git client) and created a GitHub account before showing up. Instructions for doing all that can be found in Chapters 4-9 of [this book](http://happygitwithr.com) (note -- all the rest of those chapters are also awesome).


## Some slides

<div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jeffgoldsmith/git-slides" title="Git stuff" target="_blank">Git stuff</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jeffgoldsmith" target="_blank">Jeff Goldsmith</a></strong>. </div>

After going through these slides we'll shift to an interactive demostration.

## Other materials

There's a lot of stuff to help with git in general, and with git for R in particular. This is a non-exhaustive list:

* Jenny Bryan's [book](http://happygitwithr.com) (same as the link above)
* The [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide
* Version control with [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
