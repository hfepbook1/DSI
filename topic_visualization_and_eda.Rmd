title: "Visualization and EDA"
---

Visualization and exploratory data analysis are the analytic components that immediately follow data wrangling. In addition to helping identify additional necessary wrangling steps, these are your first chance to explore the data in detail: you can explore patterns, identify trends, formulate hypotheses, and be surprised by preliminary findings. We'll discuss the elements of a good graphic before learning the tools needed to produce them, and then develop a framework for exploratory analyses using data summaries. 

The topic is made up of the following components:

* [Visualization with `ggplot2`](visualization.html)
* EDA (group_by and summarize; nesting)
