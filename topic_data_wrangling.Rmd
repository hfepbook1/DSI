title: "Data Wrangling"
---

You can't do data science without data, and data aren't going to wrangle themselves...

Data wrangling is the process of getting data in whatever format they exist and, through a variety of processes, turning those data into a form that suits your current needs. We'll talk about how to get data into R; what it means for data to be "tidy", and how to make them so; and what to do when your data are spread across multiple tables.

The topic is made up of the following components:

* [Data import](data_import.html)
* Tidy data
* Relational data

It has been argued that [data carpentry](http://www.mimno.org/articles/carpentry/) is a better term than data wrangling. I like the analogy to carpentry a lot, but most folks call this data wrangling anyway.
