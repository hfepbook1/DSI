### Context

This assignment reinforces ideas in [Collaboration](topic_collaboration.html). A PDF of this assignment is [here](homework_4.pdf).

### Due date

Due: October 30 at 1:00pm. 

### Points

* Problem 0: 40 points
* Problem 1: 20 points
* Problem 2: 20 points
* Problem 3: 20 points

### Problem 0

This "problem" focuses on structure of your submission, including the use of R Markdown to write reproducible reports, the use of R Projects to organize your work, the use of relative paths to load data, the naming structure for your files, and the use of Git and GiuHub for collaboration. 

To that end, you will submit only an HTML file, with links to GitHub repos (for Problems 1 and 2) and a link to your website (for Problem 3). The GitHub repos in Problems 1 and 2 should follow best practices for project management. In Problems 1 and 2, you will work with a partner, and your submission should make it clear who you worked with. A template submission is here.

We will assess adherence to the best practices, reproducibility, and collaboration in the grading of this problem. Adherence to appropriate styling and clarity of code will be assessed in Problems 1 and 2. This homework includes figures; the readability of your embedded plots (e.g. font sizes, axis labels, titles) will be assessed in Problems 1 and 2. 

### Problem 1

One member of the partnership will take the role of "project lead" and the other of "collaborator". The project lead should:

* create a directory
* put an R project in the directory
* initialize Git
* add the collaborator as a collaborator on GitHub
* start an R Markdown file for this problem

This problem uses the pups dataset; include that data file in your directory (or in a sub-directory), and load that data file using relative paths.

The project lead will load and tidy the data for this problem. The original data file includes data in "wide" format: the post-natal days on which developmental landmarks are reached are stored in columns called `PD_outcome`. The project lead will convert these data to "long" format, using reasonable variable names and values.

The collaborator will create a plot showing the distribution of post-natal days for each developmental landmark. 

The produced file should include code and text that explains the analyses and results.


### Problem 2

Partners whould switch roles: the former "project lead" will be the "collaborator", and the former "collaborator" will be the "project lead". The project lead should:

* create a directory
* put an R project in the directory
* initialize Git
* add the collaborator as a collaborator on GitHub
* start an R Markdown file for this problem

This problem uses the 538 datasets; include relevant data file in your directory (or in a sub-directory), and load that data file using relative paths.

The project lead will load and tidy the data for this problem. Combine the data in `pols-month.csv` and `GDP.csv` based on the date / month (use `lubridate::floor_date` to collase dates to the first day of the month).

The collaborator will create a plot showing the GDP value over time, including the party of the president in an informative aesthetic. 

The produced file should include code and text that explains the analyses and results.

### Problem 3

Create a personal website at `<YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io`. This page can be as extensive as you'd like, but it should include at least:

* A brief introductory landing page
* A page giving your academic and professional experience (i.e. a resume)
* Links in the site navigation for your GitHub account, your email, and any other professional networks.
